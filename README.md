### <h1>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h2>ðŸ˜„ About Me:</h2> <br>
<p> I'm Catherine Wickham, and an ex-scientist turned coding-fanatic looking for an opportunity to break into the software development field. I discovered coding while working with Python for bioinformatics applications, and realized that I loved the precision of solving code problems far more than the convoluted biological problems I was dealing with. I'm currently building my skills in frontend development to get started in the tech field, but my long-term goal is to become a full stack software engineer.</p>
